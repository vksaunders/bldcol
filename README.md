The Project 
-----------
Blend Images is a commercial stock photography collection. This project started with approximately 100,000 jpeg images in one directory and a csv of metadata for the pictures.

Scripts were written using Python 3 to identify images for separate collections based on keywords with geographic attributes.

The 6 collections selected are: beaches, cities, forests, landmarks, mountains, parks.

Csvs of metadata including the filename and image location were written for each collection.

Using each csv, each collectionâ€™s images were copied into new separate directories. A try-except clause returns the filenames of any images that are not found in the master directory (csvcopyfiles.py)

Looking at the images in each collection gives an assessment of keyword accuracy.

Approximately 17% of images were identified for more than one of these collections.
